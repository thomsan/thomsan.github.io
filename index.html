<p>
    Hi I'm Thomas and this is the viewing window into my universe.
    <br>
    I'm a very curious person and like to do and learn many things.
    <br>
    I don't think you can put a person into a box with a single label on it.
    E.g. describing a person with just a job title is like describing a color by its grayscale value.
    <br>
    That's why I would like to give you a description of what to expect on this website in terms of my skills and interests.
